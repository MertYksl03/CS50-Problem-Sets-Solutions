# CS50 Course Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from Harvard's CS50 course, an introduction to computer science.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About the Course
CS50 is a rigorous introduction to the fundamentals of computer science. The course covers topics such as algorithms, data structures, memory, web development, and more, using languages like C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript.

## üìö Problem Sets
The solutions are organized by problem set. Below is a list of the problem sets and their corresponding solutions:

- **Problem Set 0**: Scratch 
- **Problem Set 1**: C Basics (e.g., cash, credit, and Caesar)
- **Problem Set 2**: Arrays (e.g., substitution, cipher, search algorithms, enc)
- **Problem Set 3**: Algortihms (e.g., sort, plurarity, tideman)
- **Problem Set 4**: Memory (e.g., filter, recover, volume)
- **Problem Set 5**: Data structures (e.g., linkedlist, hash table)
- **Problem Set 6**: Python 
- **Problem Set 7**: SQL (e.g., movies, songs)
- **Problem Set 8**: Web Development (e.g., HTML, CSS Javascript)

Each directory contains my solution files, including source code, comments.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **C** for low-level programming and algorithms
- **Python** for problem-solving and web applications
- **SQL** for database management
- **HTML/CSS** for web development
- **JavaScript** for interactive web components

## üìù Running the Solutions
To run the solutions locally:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cs50-solutions.git

2. Navigate to the respective directory for a problem set.
3. Now you have my resolution to that problem set.
